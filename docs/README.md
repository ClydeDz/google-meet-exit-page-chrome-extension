# Google Meet Exit Page
Configure the exit page after ending a Google Meet call.

## Why?
Configure the exit page that should be visible after a user ends a Google Meet call. A user will have to click the 'Leave call' button from Google Meet to then be redirected to the other page. This is useful if you always need to  visit the same page after every meeting, or have a similar requirement.
